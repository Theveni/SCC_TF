# SCC_TF

This program solves sparse convex clustering and trend filtering using ADMM, AMA and other methods.

The paper to describe the method is available on arXiv:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10911

## Requirement

R 4.1.2

Environments under Windows is tested.

## Note

I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.

## Example

Refer sparse_src/sparse_example.R and TF_src/trend_example.R for a simple examples of Sparse convex clustering and Trend filtering
, respectively.
